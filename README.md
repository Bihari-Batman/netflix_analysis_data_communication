### Limitations

The Netflix userbase dataset used in this analysis has some limitations:
- The dataset contains only 2500 entries, which may not be representative of the entire Netflix userbase.
- The dataset includes the following columns: User ID, Subscription Type, Monthly Revenue, Join Date, Last Payment Date, Country, Age, Gender, Device, and Plan Duration.
- Some major countries, such as India, are not included in the dataset, which limits the scope of the analysis regarding global user demographics.
